# mm-angular-seed
A generic AngularJS seed project containing many features that I find useful.

* [Waiting indicator](http://intown.biz/2015/02/05/waiting-indicator/ Waiting Indicator) - displays a "please wait" spinner while fetching web services.
* [AngularJS interceptors for logging service calls] (http://intown.biz/2015/02/04/angularjs-interceptors/)
* Some directives
* Some filters
* Two views, "forms" and "training". 

Using bootstrap for stying.  Apart from that, no frills.  

## Setup instructions
Clone the project into a local directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mmendelson222/mm-angular-seed.git
```
Then create an http instance using your favorite web server, using the app directory as the root.

Have fun!
